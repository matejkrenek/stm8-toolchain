<!-- ABOUT THE TOOLCHAIN -->
## About The Toolchain

This toolchain is based on compilation with SDCC and programming the controller with STVP. This allows you to use all the features of C99 standard and use any programmer that is supported by STVP.

In addition to this, unused functions are removed during compilation with the use of sdccrm.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow all the steps below for desired functionality of the toolchain.

Disclaimer: the steps are described for windows because i suppose linux users are much smarter than windows users so they don't need to be guided XD

### Prerequisites

Before running the toolchain on your machine, some necessary tools need to be downloaded.

You may have some of these tools already downloaded.

#### Nodejs
- Toolchain use nodejs to handle more complex tasks (parsing json config, calculating the size of files, adjusting SPL library)
- Download (download the LTS version): [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)
#### STVP
- Programmer to flash the program to stm
- STVP comes with STVD that is distributed by STM. There are some license stuffs so to be sure everything is working properly follow these guides: [www.elektromys.eu](http://www.elektromys.eu/clanky/stm8_2_stvd/clanek.html)
#### SDCC
- Compiler to compile the program
- Download: [sdcc.sourceforge.net](https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/)
#### Others
   ```sh
   choco install git make vscode mingw
   ```
### Installation

Now when all necessary tools are downloaded you can run the toolchain on your machine. 

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
